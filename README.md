# MilkDrop3_retro


MilkDrop3_retro is a portable program that supports any audio source (Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, Winamp...)<br/>
It is based on BeatDrop from Maxim Volskiy, so it's 100% compatible with any presets created with MilkDrop and projectM.<br/>
MilkDrop3 does everything that MilkDrop2 can do, I will be only listing on this page the additional new features :)<br/><br/>
It supports a new type of double-preset (.milk2 file) mixing 2 presets and displaying them both simultaneously.<br/>
Here are a few double-preset: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UXKyz4nOfI<br/>
You can create new presets by pressing just a few keys, without knowing any lines of code<br/>
